# olm Dart Bindings

## Architecture
[Visualization](https://famedly.gitlab.io/libraries/dart-olm/#architecture).

## Using dart-olm
Beside dart-olm, the olm library itself needs to be available.

## For dart-olm developers
Look at or use the scripts `scripts/prepare.sh` and `scripts/test.sh`.
Use `codegen/codegen.sh` to update the olm functions in `lib/src/ffi.dart` and to update the JS bindings based on the native bindings.
